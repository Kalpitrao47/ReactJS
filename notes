1-Inception-
Whatever you write inside a script tag is the javascript.
ReactElement is an Object.
ReactElement(Object) =>Html(Browser Understand)

2-Igniting Our App:
First Create a New Repo in github
Initialize git in your local machine in vs code.      ---- git init
git branch -M main
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/Kalpitrao47/ReactJS.git
git push -u origin main

npm init
package.json is the configuration for the npm.

We will use Parcel library in our app. 
npm install -D parcel             (dev dependency)

There are 2 types of dependency that we can install.
>dev dependency-(Generally required in development phase).
>Normal dependency. 

What is package.json?
->Its a configuration for npm. It keeps a track of what version of that package is installed in our system. 

What is package-lock.json?
->It keeps the track of exact versions of all the dependencies.

What is node_modules?
->It is like a database of the dependencies or of the packages that our project needs.

Create a .gitignore file to ignore to node_modules
Add /node_modules inside the .gitignore file
(Because the node_modules is a big file and have much more dependencies).

npx parcel index.html(hosting our app on server).

Difference between npm and npx 
npm- Install a package 
npx- Execute a package

npm install react
npm i react-dom

Now we no longer need cdn links.

#Parcel
-Dev Build 
-Local Server
-HMR - Hot Module Replacement
-Caching - Faster Buils
-Image Optimization
-Minification
-Bundling
-Compress
-Consistant Hashing
-Code Splitting
-Differential Bundling
-Diagnostic
-Error Handling
-https


Here we are generating production build-
npx parcel build index.html
Then you will get an error. Remove main in package.json.



3-Laying the Foundation
Create Scripts in package.json for start and build 
"scripts": {
    "start":"parcel index.html",
    "build":"parcel build index.html",
    "test": "jest"
  },


Jsx is not html in js. Infact Jsx is html like syntax.

Babel job is to convert jsx to react code.
Babel is a javascript compiler.

Go to babels offical website and type this code:-
const jsxheading = <h1>USing JSx</h1>

It will convert to React.createElement as we did earlier.

How many Components are there in React?
//Class Based Components
//Functional Based Components

React Functional Component:-
A Function which is returning a jsx is a Functional Component.

The below 2 functional components are both one and the same.

1* const HeaderComponent = () =>{
    return (
    <h1>USing Functional Component</h1>
    )
}

2* const HeaderComponent = () => (
  <h1>USing Functional Component</h1>
  )


Now Call the function or component inside another Component
const TitleComponent = () =>{
    return (
    <h1>USing Functional Component Title</h1>
    )
}


const HeaderComponent = () =>{
    return (
        <>     
        {TitleComponent()}                                ------------First method 
        {TitleComponent()}                                
         {/* <TitleComponent/> */}                        ------------Second method
    <h1>USing Functional Component</h1>
    </>

    )
}
